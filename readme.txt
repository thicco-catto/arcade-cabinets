Hello to every one looking at this code, its me, Thicco Catto.

If your goal is to see how this works, go ahead, hope you enjoy
digging through all this spaghetti.

However if your goal is to see how it is done AND apply that to your mod, dont.
When I started this I new little about lua and isaac modding and some decisions 
I took back then have had horrendous consequences on the structure of this mod.

If you still manage to find some useful piece of code, it is all yours, just adding
a comment in your code saying where you got it from will be enough.
